## Course Grade

The course grade consists of the following components and percentages:

Homework: 35%

Class participation: 25%

Course project: 40%

## Homework grading

There will be 7 homeworks, each worth 5 points.
The homeworks will be assigned in the first part of the course.
To receive full credit, homework must be posted by midnight Pacific Time on the due date.
Two points will be deducted from homework received up to a week after its due date.
No credit will be given for homework more than one week late (unless there is special permission
from the instructors).
All homework, including those with extensions, must be submitted no later than midnight PT Tuesday March 15, 2016.

## Class Participation

Class participation will be graded based on the stand-up presentation (10 pts) and participation in
the technology review presentation (15 pts).

# Stand-up Presentations

Each student will do a stand-up presentation that should be one to two minutes.
You should do this without slides. The stand-up should cover the following:
(a) the deliverables for this period (e.g., were the deliverables met; if not, why? work arounds if not
met),
(b) what will be delivered next period; and (c) challenges with making the deliverables for next period.
In addition, you should provide a short write-up of your stand-up (which may just be
bullet points) that is committed to your team repo in a Standups folder.

# Technology Review Presentations

Each team will do one technology presentation on a package they are considering for their project.
All team members should participate in the preparation
of the presentation, and ideally, all team members should speak.
A single grade will be assigned to the entire team.
It is expected that students will use slides in the presentation.
The presentation should cover: (a) the project requirement being addressed by the package; (b) how
the package works;
(c) the appeal of the package;
and (d) drawbacks of the package.
The slides for the technology review should be committed to the
team repo.

## Course Project

The requirements for the class project are described in lecture 10.
Projects will be graded based on:
(a) the poster presentation, (b) documentation
(especially function and design specifications), (c) the features implemented,
and (d) code quality.
The poster presentation will be held 3pm-5pm on Tuesday March 15 in the CSE Atrium (Allen Building).
You need to [register](http://escience.washington.edu/engineering-poster-registration) in advance.
Grades for the project will be assigned to the entire team, although
there will be adjustments
for significant discrepancies in
the relative contributions of team members.
The latter will be assessed by commit logs and by
a survey students will submit
at the end of the quarter.
Projects are due by midnight PT on Tuesday March 15, 2016.
