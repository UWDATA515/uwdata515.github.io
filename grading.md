## Course Grade

The course grade consists of the following components and percentages:

Homework: 35%

Class participation: 15%

Course project: 50%

## Homework grading

* There will be 5 homework assignments with individual scores.
* Homework should be submitted using GitHub Classroom. Instructions for using GitHub Classroom follow this paragraph.
* When the assigment tells you to structure your repository in a particular directory/file structure with specific names, you must follow the instructions PRECISELY. You will lose points if you don't follow the requested directory/file naming instructions.
* **Due dates:** To receive full credit, homework must be posted by 4:59 PM Pacific Time on the due date. The due date for homework is specified in the class syllabus.
  * 20% will be deducted from homework received up to a week after its due date. No credit will be given for homework more than one week late (unless there is special permission from the instructors).
  * Class time is NOT for doing your homework, unless you have finished all of the in-class exercises that we are working on. Instructors will prioritize helping students with in-class exercises over homework. Office hours are for homework help!
* **Grading procedure:** The instructors will respond to the homework as a GitHub Issue. Please ensure that you are receiving notifications from GitHub - otherwise you will need to check your repository periodically.
* **Regrades:** You will have one week from the posting of the instructor's issue to revise your homework by updating the GitHub repository with any necessary changes and responding to the instructor's GitHub issue requesting a regrade. Regrades are to help with your learning, NOT to aid in procrastination. Use office hours to help you understand your mistakes if you do not already. You may request at most ONE regrade per homework assignment - please make sure you validate your code and understand the instructor's comments before requesting the regrade. If you do not respond to the instructor's comment requesting a regrade, *you will not receive a regrade*. Your score will never decrease as a result of requesting a regrade.

Instructions for using Github Classroom.

1. Click the link for the homework on the syllabus page. This will create a repository for you.

1. Clone the repository on your machine.

1. Do the homework on your machine.

1. ``git add`` new files that you create in your repo.

1. ``git commit`` and ``git push`` to submit your homework. You may do many pushes as long
as they are before the homework due date.


## Class Participation

Class participation will be graded based on project-related presentations, participation in polling in and outside of class, and participation in in-class activities. If you will be absent from a class in which we have group work or presentations/demos (noted on the syllabus), please let the instructor know.

We expect that everyone has presented part of their group's presentation (tech review, practice presentation / summary, final presentation).

## Course Project

[Description of Class Project](projects.md)

Projects will be graded based on:
(a) the final presentation, (b) documentation
(especially function and design specifications), (c) the features implemented,
and (d) code quality.
(Details of the grading rubric can be found
in the Projects tab.)
Grades for the project will be assigned to the entire team, although
there will be adjustments
for significant discrepancies in
the relative contributions of team members.
The latter will be assessed by commit logs and by
a survey students will submit
at the end of the quarter.
