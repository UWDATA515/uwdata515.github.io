## Course Grade

The course grade consists of the following components and percentages:

Homework: 35%

Class participation: 15%

Course project: 50%

## Homework grading

There will be 7 homeworks, each worth 5 points.
The homeworks will be assigned in the first part of the course.
To receive full credit, homework must be posted by midnight Pacific Time on the due date.
Unless otherwise stated otherwise, homework is due on Monday at 11:59 PM.
Two points will be deducted from homework received up to a week after its due date.
No credit will be given for homework more than one week late (unless there is special permission
from the instructors).
**All homework, including those with extensions, must be submitted no later than midnight PT Tuesday
May 29, 2018.**

## Peer Review

We will use a peer review process to grade homeworks.
This means that two of your classmates will review your homework, and you will review two homeworks done by your classmates via common grading rubric.

There are several reasons why we‚Äôre doing peer-reviewed homework. 
Foremost, critical parts of software engineering are a social and collaborative process. We want you to have experience early with code review,  which is a key component of effective collaboration. 
Second, the mechanisms for peer review will rely on github; so, doing peer reviews will advance your knowledge of this vital tool. 
Last, the interest in CSE 583 has grown beyond our capacity to grade homework in a scalable way. Peer review provides a way for us to have more students take the course.

Here are the details of the peer review process:

1. Each homework you submit will be a separate github repository. 
   We will randomly assign two members of the class as collaborators for each homework repository. 
   These collaborators will be your reviewers. 
1. For each review we will open a repository issue containing the review rubric. To review a classmate's homework, you will
   evaluate your peer's repository and check-off components of the rubric in the issue.
1. Reviewers will have 1 week from the date of submission to input their initial review in the rubric, leave an issue
   comment with an initial grade (e.g. `4/5 Great initial work. üëç`), and comment on what improvements can be made. 
1. You will respond to reviews in dialog by using the github issue mechanism. This may include changing your homework to
   accommodate observations from the reviewers, asking questions to refine the issues raised by the reviewers, and/or
   respectfully debating the reviewer's score. Reviewers should respond to your response, and are expected to update their
   review and grading  of the homework in a timely fashion.
1. The final review is due 2 weeks after the original assignment due date. Reviews must submit their review by closing the
   review issue with a comment including their final review score. (e.g. `5/5 Perfect revision! üëè`) Reviews at full credit
   may be closed on any date. Reviews with partial credit may be closed at any time on the final review due date or with
   the mutual consent of the reviewer/reviewee.
1. Your final grade will be the average of the grades assigned by your reviewers when the homework repository is closed. 
   You will receive this grade only if you completed the two reviews that you were assigned for that homework, including a
   timely initial review and final review.
 
Please contact one of the instructors by email if there is an issue with how the collaboration works for grading homework.

## Class Participation

Class participation will be graded based on project related presentations for project standups and technology reviews.

## Course Project

[Description of Class Project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14XfgSuko_hfYbNBq8agz31CxnmIJkw2Iz8yW0cs-mSY/edit?usp=sharing)

Projects will be graded based on:
(a) the poster presentation, (b) documentation
(especially function and design specifications), (c) the features implemented,
and (d) code quality.
(Details of the grading rubric can be found
in the Projects tab.)
Grades for the project will be assigned to the entire team, although
there will be adjustments
for significant discrepancies in
the relative contributions of team members.
The latter will be assessed by commit logs and by
a survey students will submit
at the end of the quarter.
