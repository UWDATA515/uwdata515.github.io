  </header>

  <article class="post-content">
    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The course project is a “capstone” that pulls together all elements of the course:
data, programming, coding style,
version control, testing, design, and team collaborations.
This is a team effort, often with members drawn from different disciplines.</p>

<p>Projects will address a science or business question of interest.
For example, a business question related to the
bike sharing company Pronto might be “How should bicycles be allocated
among stations?”
An <strong>analysis project</strong> would seek data to answer this question
directly.
However, you may choose not to answer the question
yourself.
Rather, you might do a <strong>tool project</strong> that builds
a tool to help
others to answer the question.
For example, one such tool might be a package that
better organizes
the Pronto data for analysis.
Still another possibility is that you will build a system that teaches
others the skills needed to do analysis, which
we call an
<strong>instructional system project</strong>.
An example here would be
a system that teaches about logistics for businesses in the
sharing economy.
Other types of projects are possible as well.</p>

<h2 id="project-workflow">Project Workflow</h2>

<h3 id="step-1-pick-your-data">Step 1: Pick Your Data</h3>
<p>You should have two data sets so that you can demonstrate an ability
to join data with different characteristics (e.g., granularity in time and/or space).
The data must be available immediately, without concerns
about access rights for team members or the instructors.</p>

<h3 id="step-2-define-the-problem">Step 2: Define the Problem</h3>
<p>Determine the type of project  (e.g., analysis project) and the
questions of interest.</p>

<h3 id="step-3-write-the-functional-specification">Step 3: Write the Functional Specification</h3>
<p>The functional specification details:</p>

<ul>
  <li>who are the users and what do they know (e.g., business analyst)</li>
  <li>what information users want from the system (e.g., where to put bicycles)</li>
  <li>use cases - how users interact with the system to get the 
information they want</li>
</ul>

<p>For tool projects, the users are typically programmers, and so the
functional specification describes the programming interface.</p>

<h3 id="steps-4-and-beyond-iteratively-develop-and-refine-the-project">Steps 4 and beyond: Iteratively Develop And Refine the Project</h3>
<p>You will organize the project as a set of short-term deliverables.
Typically, you focus first on those parts where you have
the most uncertainty since projects typically fail because
of “unknown unknowns”.
For some projects, this will be a data-first focus to make sure that
your data can answer the questions that you pose.
For others, it may be exploring a python package that you hope
will provide key features (e.g., visualizations).</p>

<h2 id="project-structure">Project Structure</h2>
<p>Projects should have a github repository with the project name.
Top level folders/files within the repository include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>README.md file that gives an overview of the project</li>
  <li>LICENSE file</li>
  <li>setup.py file that initializes the project after it has been cloned</li>
  <li>doc folder that contains documentation (including the functional specification,
the design specification, and the final project presentation or poster)</li>
  <li>python package folder (with the same name as the repository)
that is structured as one or more python modules 
(e.g., with <strong>init</strong>.py files) and test files that begin with “test_”.</li>
  <li>examples folder that contains examples of using the packages</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="design-documents">Design Documents</h2>

<p>You will create two documents describing the design of your project. 
These documents should be in your project <code class="highlighter-rouge">docs</code> folder.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Functional Specification</strong>. The document should have the following sections:
    <ul>
      <li>Background. The problem being addressed.</li>
      <li>User profile. Who uses the system. What they know about the domain and computing (e.g., can browse the web, can program in Python)</li>
      <li>Data sources. What data you will use and how it is structured.</li>
      <li>Use cases. Describing at least two use cases. For each, describe: (a) the objective of the user interaction (e.g., withdraw money from an ATM); and (b) the expected interactions between the user and your system.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Component Specification</strong>. The document should have sections for.
    <ul>
      <li>Software components. High level description of the software components such as: <em>data manager</em>, which provides a simplified interface to your data and provides application specific features (e.g., querying data subsets); and <em>visualization manager</em>, which displays data frames as a plot. Describe at least 3 components specifying: what it does, inputs it requires, and outputs it provides.</li>
      <li>Interactions to accomplish use cases. Describe how the above software components interact to accomplish at least one of your use cases.</li>
      <li>Preliminary plan. A list of tasks in priority order.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="technology-review-presentation">Technology Review Presentation</h2>
<p>The technology review is about making decisions about the choice of a python library to address a technology need in the project. For example, many projects make use of map visualizations. There are many python libraries that support these visualizations such as Bokeh, Dash, and googlemaps. The libraries have different capbilities, such as what (if any) interactions users can have with the map. You will want to choose a library that: (a) addresses the requirements of your project; (b) is compatible with other elements of your project (e.g., runs on python 3); (c) is relatively easy to use; (d) is computationally efficient for the scale of data you use; and (d) doesn’t have software bugs that will impair your use cases.</p>

<p>The technology review is a group presentation. It should be about 5-7 minutes in length. The presentation should address the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Brief background on the problem you’re solving to motivate a technology for which you need a python library (e.g., interactive maps).</li>
  <li>One slide desciption of a use case in which the technology is required.</li>
  <li>One slide that describes at least two python libraries that potentially address your technology requirement.</li>
  <li>One slide side-by-side comparisons of the technologies. This will require that you actually install and use the technologies.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="project-presentation">Project Presentation</h2>
<p>Teams 
will present their projects using slides in
10 minute oral presentation.
The presentation should include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Background. Describe the problem or area being addressed.</li>
  <li>Data used. What data did you use? How was it obtained? What are its limitations?</li>
  <li>Use cases. How users will interact with your system in a way that addresses the problem area.</li>
  <li>Demo. Demonstrate your software.</li>
  <li>Design. Describe the components and how they interact to accomplish the use cases.</li>
  <li>Project Structure. Show the structure of your github repository.</li>
  <li>Lessons learned and future work. Focus on <em>software engineering</em> lessons.</li>
</ul>

<p>You should post a PDF of your presentation in the docs folder of your project.</p>

<h2 id="grading-rubric">Grading Rubric</h2>
<p>Projects will be evaluated based on the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Organized as described in the section on project structure</li>
  <li>Quality of the documentation (especially the functional
specification and design specification)</li>
  <li>Uses at least two data sources</li>
  <li>Code quality, especially consistent coding standard (e.g., <code class="highlighter-rouge">pylint</code>).</li>
  <li>Test coverage</li>
  <li>Quality of the example of using the package (in the examples
folder of the project repository)</li>
  <li>Implements continuous integration (e.g., via travis-CI), and all tests pass.</li>
  <li>Completeness of the setup.py script</li>
  <li>Creativity and technical challenge</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="examples-of-previous-projects">Examples of previous projects</h2>
<p>These examples are fantastic, though they may not be perfect. They should be considered examples of what kinds of projects are possible and not necessarily exa mples to be precisely emulated.  The examples below include an analysis project, a visualization project and a reusable data project.</p>
