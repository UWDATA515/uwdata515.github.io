For students interested in pursuing more depth in software engineering, we recommend a number
of courses in the
Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering that are intended
for non-CSE students..

- 373: Data Structures and Algorithms. The course teaches
fundamental algorithms and data structures for implementation.
Techniques for solving problems by programming. Linked lists, stacks,
queues, directed graphs. Trees: representations, traversals. Searching
(hashing, binary search trees, multiway trees). Garbage collection,
memory management. Internal and external sorting.

- 374: Intermediate Programming Concepts and Tools. The course
covers key software development concepts and tools not in
introductory courses. Concepts of lower-level programming (C/C++) and
explicit memory management; techniques and tools for individual and
group software development; design, implementation, and testing
strategies.

- 410: Architecture and Operating Systems.

- 412: Visualization

- 413: Languages and Compilers

- 414: Database Systems

- 416: Machine Learning
