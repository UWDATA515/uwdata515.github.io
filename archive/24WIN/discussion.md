Our class discussion forum will be located on [Ed Discussions](https://edstem.org/us/courses/32135).

While the standard in external industry is Slack, we unfortunately cannot
use Slack as an official course discussion forum. You are encouraged to use
Slack if you would like to with your teammates as part of the course
project.

Access [Ed Discussions](https://edstem.org/us/courses/32135) to
ask questions and see what other students are thinking about.
